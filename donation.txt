Bangladesh is one of the world’s most densely populated countries. Roughly the size of Florida, it is home to over 160 million people, compared to Florida’s 21 million.

Join a passionate community of monthly givers on a mission to end global poverty.

Your monthly donation provides Just Peoples with the consistent financial support needed to sustainably lift some of the world’s most vulnerable out of poverty.

Your support shows that lasting, large-scale change is possible. Last year, we changed the lives of over 2,623,000 children in Bangladesh. Together, we’re giving them the opportunities every child deserves – to grow up healthy, learning and safe.

Donate Everyday has been working with children, families, communities and government ministries in Bangladesh since 1970, including through sponsorship since 1972.
